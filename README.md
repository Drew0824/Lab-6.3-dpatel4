# The equality relational operator 

##  Step 1 

Run the program several times using a different input each time. Does the program do what you think it was meant to be doing? If not, locate the error and fix it.

## Step 2 

Modify the program so that the user inputs both values to be tested for equality. Make sure you have a prompt for each input. Test the program with pairs of values that are the same and that are different.

## Step 3 

Modify the program so that when the numbers are the same it prints the following two lines: 

**The values are the same. 
Hey thatâ€™s a coincidence!**

## Step 4

Modify the program by replacing the two if statements with a single if/else statement. Run the program again to test the results.
